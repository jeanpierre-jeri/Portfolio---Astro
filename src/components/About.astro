      <p>
          Since I was a child I've liked technology, I started with videogames and they made me discover
          programming, it was at that time that I dedicated myself to learning
          different types of programming languages.
      </p>
      <p>
          I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one
          problem at a time.
          If you want to contact me, I am excited about new challenges and solving problems through code.
